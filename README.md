Once in game, your goal is to fill entirely the grid by linking the cells with the same pictogram.

To do so, press your mouse button on a pictogram and then drag your mouse on each free cells you wanna fill,
then finish your path on the other cell with the pictogram you started on, and then release your mouse button.

If the level is too difficult, you can leave the level by pressing the button on the bottom of the screen.
